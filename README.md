# 📊 Data Analysis and Data Science with Python - Task 6

1. **Time Series Analysis** — Forecasting sales data using ARIMA.
2. **Heart Disease Prediction** — Classifying patients using logistic regression.

## 📈 Project 1: Time Series Analysis

### 🧠 Objective
Analyze and forecast sales data over time using statistical models, particularly ARIMA.

1. **Dataset Selection**
   - Dataset contains:
     - `Date`: Timestamp of recorded sales
     - `Sales`: Number of units sold or revenue

2. **Tasks Performed**
   - Visualized sales trends using line charts and moving averages
   - Identified seasonality, trends, and anomalies
   - Applied ARIMA model for forecasting
   - Evaluated model accuracy using RMSE/MAPE

3. **Deliverables**
   - 📊 Trend Analysis Plot
   - 🔮 Forecast Plot (actual vs predicted)
   - 📁 Forecasted Sales Data Table

##  Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction (Logistic Regression)

### 🧠 Objective
Predict the presence of heart disease using key medical metrics.

### 🔄 Steps Followed

1. **Dataset Selection**
   - Dataset: `heart_disease.csv`
   - Features:
     - `Age`
     - `Gender`
     - `Cholesterol`
     - `Blood Pressure`
     - `Heart Disease` (target variable)

2. **Tasks Performed**
   - Cleaned dataset (handled missing/duplicate values)
   - Normalized numerical features
   - Trained Logistic Regression model
   - Evaluated using:
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Precision, Recall, F1-score

3. **Deliverables**
   - 🧠 Trained Logistic Regression Model
   - 📋 Evaluation Report with metrics and matrix
